# Javascript Password Vault CLI Tool

## Introduction 
- This is a fun project where I provided my solution to a Coding Challenge [Build Your Own Password Manager](https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-password-manager/) by [John Crickett](https://github.com/JohnCrickett) 

## Install
```
npm install -g vault
```

## Features
- Create a new password vault
- Sign in to an existing password vault
- Add a password to a vault
- Fetch a password from a vault

## Security
- The vault uses the symmetric encryption algorithm AES-256 to encrypt the credentials for each record

## Usage
Enter the following command and a menu will appear giving the different choices to create a new vault, signing in, adding or fetching password.
```
vault
```
